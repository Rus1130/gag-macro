Try to have the camera as level as possible. The camera must be DIRECLY ABOVE your character.
2. Make sure that the Recall Wrench is in your **2nd** slot and is not equipped when the macro starts.
3. In order to run the macro, make sure that you click the "Set Config" button and follow the directions on-screen. This needs to be done only once, but can be done as many times as you want. This allows for certain variables to be set that cannot normally be changed by the user via the UI.
